# Roblox API Request
 A simple Node.js application that makes HTTP/HTTPS requests to the Roblox API using a custom roblox-machine-id header. This project includes robust error handling, environment variable support, and customizable request configurations.

## Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
ROBLOX_MACHINE_ID=your-roblox-machine-id
MAX_CONCURRENT=1
MIN_TIME=1000
```
